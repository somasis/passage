PASSAGE(1)                          passage                         PASSAGE(1)



NAME
       passage - password store utilizing age for encryption

SYNOPSIS
       passage show [-c] [FILE/DIRECTORY...]

       passage convert [DIRECTORY]

       passage generate [-l LENGTH] FILE

       passage edit FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       passage is a password store. It allows for storing passwords within a
       directory, by default ~/.local/share/passage, encrypting them with
       age(1). It is a reimplementation of pass(1), with some deviations where
       pass(1) is possibly a bit inconsistent and feature creep prone.

COMMANDS
       show [-c] [FILE/DIRECTORY]
           Show a list of password files and directories.  Password files have
           their ".age" suffix removed for readability.

               If you provide a path to a password file, the contents are printed to standard output.

               If *-c* is specified, the contents are instead copied to your X clipboard using xsel(1),
               and then it is cleared after 45 seconds.

               If you provide a path to a password directory, the directory is listed.
               If you provide no path of any sort, the entire password store is listed.

       convert [DIRECTORY]
           Convert a pass(1) password store, DIRECTORY to a passage(1) store.
           All files are decrypted using gpg(1), and then reencrypted with
           age(1).  If unspecified, DIRECTORY is PASSWORD_STORE_DIR (which is
           ~/.password-store by default).

       generate [-l LENGTH] FILE
           Generate a password of LENGTH characters long to FILE. If a custom
           LENGTH is unspecified, the default length is 24 characters long.
           The password contains alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation
           symbols.

       edit FILE
           Decrypt and open FILE in your editor. The file is written to a
           temporary file with owner-only read and write permissions, and then
           written back to the original location.

ENVIRONMENT
       EDITOR
           The default editor used by the edit command. If not set, defaults
           to vi(1).

       PASSAGE_DIR
           A directory containing the password store.  If not specified,
           ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/passage is used instead.

       PASSAGE_KEY
           A file path. This is the key used for encrypting passwords; your
           private key.  If not specified, ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/privkey
           is used.

       PASSAGE_RECIPIENTS
           A file path. This is the list of public keys that password files
           are encrypted for.  As in, this is what public keys should be able
           to decrypt password files.  If not specified,
           ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/recipients is used.

       PASSWORD_STORE_DIR
           If set, this directory is used by convert, rather than pass(1)'s
           own default, ~/.password-store.'

FILES
       ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/privkey
           The default location of the encrypting key, or private key.  The
           encrypting key can be changed with PASSAGE_KEY.  By default
           XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to ~/.config.

       ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/recipients
           The default location of the recipients list.  The location can be
           changed with PASSAGE_RECIPIENTS.  By default XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set
           to ~/.config.

       ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/passage
           The default location of the password store.  The location can be
           changed with PASSAGE_DIR.  By default, XDG_DATA_HOME is set to
           ~/.local/share.

       ${PASSAGE_DIR}/passage/*.age
           Files encrypted with age(1).

NOTES
       Since age(1) supports using SSH public/private key pairs for encrypting
       and decrypting, you can actually just set PASSAGE_KEY to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
       (or similar) and PASSAGE_RECIPIENTS to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (again, or
       similar), and use your SSH keys for things.
