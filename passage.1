.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpassage\fP is a password store. It allows for storing passwords within a directory, by default
\fI${XDG_DATA_HOME}/share/passage\fP, encrypting them with age(1). It is based on the design of pass(1),
with deviation where pass(1) seems inconsistent or prone to feature\-creep.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

.\}
Usage of age(1) rather than gpg(1). This helps to reduce the overall amount of cruft and bloat
being used in cryptography programs, and while it\(cqs mostly a philosophical reason, it\(cqs the main
reason this was written.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
POSIX sh(1) compatibility. pass(1) depends on bash(1), and uses quite a lot of bashisms, making
using it with other default system shells require a lot of changes to the code. \fBpassage\fP doesn\(cqt
have any non\-POSIX compatible requirements, aside from age(1).
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
A preference of printing easily machine\-readable content by default. pass(1)\(aqs output tends to be
geared more towards human\-readability, which can occasionally be annoying for scripting and
automated usage.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Avoidance of piece\-meal operations on password files. Most password editing operations, other
than generating a new password, should just be done through a text editor.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Don\(cqt automate much by default, and don\(cqt duplicate functionality; for example, this means that
unlike pass(1), the generate command does \fBnot\fP copy to the clipboard with a switch, because
\fBshow \-c\fP will do that just fine. Directories are also not automatically created when necessary.

Conforming to XDG specifications by default. pass(1) does not, though it can be made to.
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
.sp
When providing a password file as an argument, do not include the ".age" suffix.
.sp
\fBcp\fP [\fB\-fr\fP] \fISOURCE\fP \fIDESTINATION\fP
.RS 4
Copy a password file or directory from \fISOURCE\fP to \fIDESTINATION\fP. \fB\-f\fP will allow overwriting
existing files. \fB\-r\fP will copy a directory recursively.
.RE
.sp
\fBconvert\fP [\fB\-v\fP] [\fIDIRECTORY\fP]
.RS 4
Convert a pass(1) password store, \fIDIRECTORY\fP to a passage(1) store.
All files are decrypted using gpg(1), and then reencrypted with age(1).
If \fB\-v\fP is specified, the gpg(1)\-encrypted files will be listed to standard error
as they are converted.
If unspecified, \fIDIRECTORY\fP is \fIPASSWORD_STORE_DIR\fP (which is \fI~/.password\-store\fP by default).
.RE
.sp
\fBedit\fP \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Decrypt and open \fIFILE\fP in your editor. The decrypted file is written to a temporary file with
owner\-only read and write permissions, and then written back to the original location.
.RE
.sp
\fBgenerate\fP [\fB\-f\fP] [\fB\-l\fP \fILENGTH\fP] \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Generate a password of \fILENGTH\fP characters long to \fIFILE\fP. If a custom \fILENGTH\fP is unspecified,
the default length is 24 characters long. The password contains alphabetical, numeric, and
punctuation symbols. If the password file already exists, it will not overwrite it.
If \fB\-f\fP is specified, it will.
.RE
.sp
\fBinit\fP
.RS 4
Create the password store directory. No arguments are taken, as the directory and keys (if not
defaults) should be set in the config or environment (see \fIENVIRONMENT\fP and \fIFILES\fP) anyway.
.RE
.sp
\fBln\fP [\fB\-f\fP] \fITARGET\fP \fIDESTINATION\fP
.RS 4
Create a symbolic link at \fIDESTINATION\fP that resolves to \fITARGET\fP. \fB\-f\fP will allow overwriting
existing files and links.
.RE
.sp
\fBmkdir\fP [\fB\-p\fP] \fIDIRECTORY\fP...
.RS 4
Create a directory named \fIDIRECTORY\fP. \fB\-p\fP will create all parents of the directory if they do
not exist.
.RE
.sp
\fBmv\fP [\fB\-f\fP] \fISOURCE\fP \fIDESTINATION\fP
.RS 4
Move the \fISOURCE\fP file or directory to \fIDESTINATION\fP. \fB\-f\fP will allow overwriting files.
.RE
.sp
\fBrm\fP [\fB\-fr\fP] \fIFILE/DIRECTORY\fP...
.RS 4
Delete a file/directory in the password store. \fB\-f\fP will not error out if the file or directory
doesn\(cqt exist. \fB\-r\fP will remove a directory recursively.
.RE
.sp
\fBshow\fP [\fB\-c\fP] [\fIFILE/DIRECTORY\fP...]
.RS 4
Show a list of password files and directories, or show the contents of a password file.
Directories are listed with a trailing slash (\fI/\fP) at the end of a line, files are not.
Files have their ".age" suffix removed for readability.
If a path to a password file is given, the contents of that file are printed to standard output.
If \fB\-c\fP is specified and a password file is given, the contents are copied to your X clipboard
using xsel(1), rather than being printed, and then the clipboard is cleared after 45 seconds.
If you provide a path to a password directory, the directory is listed.
If you provide no path of any sort, the entire password store is listed.
.RE
.SH "VARIABLES"
.sp
These variables can be set in the configuration file (see \fIFILES\fP). If they are in the environment,
the environment variables will take priority.
.sp
\fIEDITOR\fP
.RS 4
The default editor used by the \fBedit\fP command. If not set, it defaults to vi(1).
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSAGE_DIR\fP
.RS 4
A directory containing the password store.
If not specified, \fI${XDG_DATA_HOME}/passage\fP is used instead.
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSAGE_KEY\fP
.RS 4
A file path. This is the key used for encrypting passwords; your private key.
If not specified, \fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/privkey\fP is used.
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSAGE_RECIPIENTS\fP
.RS 4
A file path. This is the list of public keys that password files are encrypted \fBfor\fP; as in,
this is what public keys should be able to decrypt password files.
If not specified, \fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/recipients\fP is used.
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSWORD_STORE_DIR\fP
.RS 4
If set, this directory is used by \fBconvert\fP, rather than pass(1)\(aqs own default,
\fI~/.password\-store\fP. It\(cqs not used if you provide directories as arguments to \fBconvert\fP, though.
This environment variable is also used by pass(1), thus the reason it is used here.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.sp
\fI${PASSAGE_DIR}/*.age\fP
.RS 4
Files encrypted with age(1).
.RE
.sp
\fI${XDG_DATA_HOME}/passage\fP
.RS 4
The default location of the password store.
The location can be changed with \fIPASSAGE_DIR\fP.
By default, \fIXDG_DATA_HOME\fP is set to \fB~/.local/share\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/passage.conf\fP
.RS 4
The default location of the configuration. Any variable in \fIVARIABLES\fP can be set here.
By default \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is set to \fB~/.config\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/privkey\fP
.RS 4
The default location of the encrypting key, or private key.
The encrypting key can be changed with \fIPASSAGE_KEY\fP.
By default \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is set to \fB~/.config\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/recipients\fP
.RS 4
The default location of the recipients list.
The location can be changed with \fIPASSAGE_RECIPIENTS\fP.
By default \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is set to \fB~/.config\fP.
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
Since age(1) supports using SSH public/private key pairs for encrypting and decrypting, you can
actually just set \fIPASSAGE_KEY\fP to \fB~/.ssh/id_rsa\fP (or similar) and \fIPASSAGE_RECIPIENTS\fP to
\fB~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\fP (again, or similar), and use your SSH keys for things.
.SH "BUGS"
