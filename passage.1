.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpassage\fP is a password store. It allows for storing passwords within a directory, by default
\fI${XDG_DATA_HOME}/share/passage\fP, encrypting them with age(1). It is based in design off of pass(1),
with deviations where pass(1) is possibly inconsistent or feature\-creep prone.

.el \{\

.\}
Usage of age(1) rather than gpg(1). This helps to reduce the overall amount of cruft and bloat
being used in cryptography programs, and while it\(cqs mostly a philosophical reason, it\(cqs the main
reason this was written.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
POSIX sh(1) compatibility. pass(1) depends on bash(1), and uses quite a lot of bashisms, making
using it with other default system shells require a lot of changes to the code. \fBpassage\fP doesn\(cqt
have any non\-POSIX compatible requirements, aside from age(1).

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
A preference of printing easily machine\-readable content by default. pass(1)\(aqs output tends to be
geared more towards human\-readability, which can occasionally be annoying for scripting and
automated usage.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Avoidance of piece\-meal operations on password files. Most password editing operations, other
than generating a new password, should just be done through a text editor.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

Conforming to XDG specifications by default. pass(1) does not, though it can be made to.
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
.sp
When providing a password file as an argument, do not include the ".age" suffix.
.sp
\fBshow\fP [\fB\-c\fP] [\fIFILE/DIRECTORY\fP...]
.RS 4
Show a list of password files and directories, or show the contents of a password file.
Directories are listed with a trailing slash (\fI/\fP) at the end of a line, files do not.
Files have their ".age" suffix removed for readability.
If a path to a password file is given, the contents of that file are printed to standard output.
If \fB\-c\fP is specified and a password file is given, the contents are copied to your X clipboard
using xsel(1), rather than being printed, and then the clipboard is cleared after 45 seconds.
If you provide a path to a password directory, the directory is listed.
If you provide no path of any sort, the entire password store is listed.
.RE
.sp
\fBconvert\fP [\fB\-v\fP] [\fIDIRECTORY\fP]
.RS 4
Convert a pass(1) password store, \fIDIRECTORY\fP to a passage(1) store.
All files are decrypted using gpg(1), and then reencrypted with age(1).
If \fB\-v\fP is specified, the gpg(1)\-encrypterd files will be listed to standard error
as they are converted.
If unspecified, \fIDIRECTORY\fP is \fIPASSWORD_STORE_DIR\fP (which is \fI~/.password\-store\fP by default).
.RE
.sp
\fBgenerate\fP [\fB\-l\fP \fILENGTH\fP] \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Generate a password of \fILENGTH\fP characters long to \fIFILE\fP. If a custom \fILENGTH\fP is unspecified,
the default length is 24 characters long. The password contains alphabetical, numeric, and
punctuation symbols.
.RE
.sp
\fBedit\fP \fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Decrypt and open \fIFILE\fP in your editor. The decrypted file is written to a temporary file with
owner\-only read and write permissions, and then written back to the original location.
.RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
\fIEDITOR\fP
.RS 4
The default editor used by the \fBedit\fP command. If not set, it defaults to vi(1).
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSAGE_DIR\fP
.RS 4
A directory containing the password store.
If not specified, \fI${XDG_DATA_HOME}/passage\fP is used instead.
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSAGE_KEY\fP
.RS 4
A file path. This is the key used for encrypting passwords; your private key.
If not specified, \fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/privkey\fP is used.
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSAGE_RECIPIENTS\fP
.RS 4
A file path. This is the list of public keys that password files are encrypted \fBfor\fP; as in,
this is what public keys should be able to decrypt password files.
If not specified, \fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/recipients\fP is used.
.RE
.sp
\fIPASSWORD_STORE_DIR\fP
.RS 4
If set, this directory is used by \fBconvert\fP, rather than pass(1)\(aqs own default,
\fI~/.password\-store\fP.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.sp
\fI${XDG_DATA_HOME}/passage\fP
.RS 4
The default location of the password store.
The location can be changed with \fIPASSAGE_DIR\fP.
By default, \fIXDG_DATA_HOME\fP is set to \fB~/.local/share\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/privkey\fP
.RS 4
The default location of the encrypting key, or private key.
The encrypting key can be changed with \fIPASSAGE_KEY\fP.
By default \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is set to \fB~/.config\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fI${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/passage/recipients\fP
.RS 4
The default location of the recipients list.
The location can be changed with \fIPASSAGE_RECIPIENTS\fP.
By default \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is set to \fB~/.config\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fI${PASSAGE_DIR}/*.age\fP
.RS 4
Files encrypted with age(1).
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.sp
Since age(1) supports using SSH public/private key pairs for encrypting and decrypting, you can
actually just set \fIPASSAGE_KEY\fP to \fB~/.ssh/id_rsa\fP (or similar) and \fIPASSAGE_RECIPIENTS\fP to
\fB~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\fP (again, or similar), and use your SSH keys for things.
